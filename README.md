E-TMA.bot
-------

The kinder, simpler cousin of LIGMA.bot. :smile:

# Setup instructions

## 1. Create bot account somewhere

I like [botsin.space](https://botsin.space) personally

## 2. Create an API token

This is a multi stage step!

i. Go to "Edit Profile" once logged into your bot account
ii. Click the "Developer" link in the sidebar
iii. Click "New Application"
iv. Give it a name, leave everything else the same; click Done
v. Go back to your bot after creating it
vi. Copy the newly generated big-ass string in the "Your access token" field

Note, be careful with this token as anyone with it can act as that user!

### 3. Click dis button hurrr vvvv
